This script runs DO on the synthetic problems described by Jamie in his thesis. It solves
these problems, and outputs the number of evaluations taken to solve them on a graph. Different
problem types can be specified to ensure the performance of this implementation of DO is 
similar to that shown in Jamie's thesis.
