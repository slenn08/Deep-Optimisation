These files describe a subset of problems from P.C.Chu and J.E.Beasley
"A genetic algorithm for the multidimensional knapsack problem" (1997),
of size 100, with their respective best known fitnesses. In each file,
the first 10 problems have a tightness ratio of 0.25, the second 10
0.5, and the last 10 0.75.
